Problem Narrative
-----------------

Group of people needs to propose game play dates and indicate availability
on said dates.

Data Model
----------

At Least:

  Players
  Playdates
  Availability

Possibly:

  Decision

Considerations
--------------

The players are also users, so the Player model is also used for login etc.
Dates are created by the players. All players can add dates. Shortcuts
exist to add certain often-used date ranges (all fridays in a month, all
saturdays in a month, etc.). No dates can be added in the past, nor more
than N months in the future. Each player can only indicate his own
availability.
